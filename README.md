<hr>

<h2>Studio Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>1. First, you'll need the SyncAdmin model found <a href="http://www.roblox.com/library/549677290/SyncAdmin">here</a></p>

<p>2. Once you've got the SyncAdmin model, you'll need to insert it into your place via Roblox Studio</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> We highly recommend inserting it into <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.phptitle=API:Class/ServerScriptService">ServerScriptService</a> for security</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3. Finally, let's make sure <a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/HttpService">HttpService</a> is enabled by checking the HttpEnabled property.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> You do not need to add yourself to the admin list as the game owner is granted level 3 (super administrator) permissions automatically. However, if you need to add developers, etc. to your game, make sure to open the Settings module found inside the SyncAdmin loader and edit the BaseAdmins setting. More information found (here when there's a wiki page for it).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>In-Game Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>1. While in game, if you are the game owner or have level 3 permissions (super administrator) then run the !!settings command - (Prefix may be different)

<p>2. Once you've ran the settings command, a settings window will open up like below:</p>
